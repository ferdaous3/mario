💻 This repository contains my solution to the Mario Pyramid project from CS50x 2024 (Introduction to Computer Science, Harvard University). The program is written in C and demonstrates my ability to apply key programming concepts such as ✅ input validation, 🔁 loops (for, while), and ⭐ nested loops for pattern generation — all with a focus on clean and efficient code. The user is prompted for a pyramid height (1-8), and the program outputs a right-aligned pyramid of hashes (#) that adjusts dynamically to the chosen height. To run the program: compile with make mario, run it using ./mario, and enter a valid height. This project reflects my dedication to mastering computer science fundamentals and writing clear, functional, and well-structured code. 🚀
